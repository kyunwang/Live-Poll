Started using es5 only to get support to ie10

##Todo
add some more codecomments

add a timelimit
add a timer with the timelimit

implemment sass
implemment 'private' users

rework the client js
rework the websockets and look more into it

host this somewhere
Host the database instead of using localhost (connect to cloud database)

add install instructions ect




use nunjucks instead of ejs?
put the poll in a iframe in case one does not support websockets? (will use the meta refresh instead)

maybe use a lib like virtual-dom or moon.js to make the updating easier
look into postcss?


## Issues
- Styling on IE11 (euhm fix worthy?)
